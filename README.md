#CS 310 Project Team E

This is the repository for the CS310 project of Team E. Our team developed a time clock application for businesses to track employee attendance and work hours.

Introduction
The purpose of our project is to create a reliable clock that businesses can use to monitor employee attendance and calculate payroll. The application will have features such as clock-in/clock-out functionality, shift scheduling, and reporting tools to help businesses manage their workforce more efficiently.

Methodology
We used Java for the programming languages, We implemented the clock-in and clock-out functionality while ensuring that the workers are dealt with when clocking in and out late or early. We created a Payroll system with this data connected to the clock time for each user connected to the Database.

We conducted user testing to ensure that the application was intuitive and user-friendly. We also implemented security measures to protect sensitive employee data and prevent unauthorized access.

Results
Our time clock application was successfully developed. The clock-in/clock-out functionality, Payroll payout, and reporting tools were all implemented and working as intended. The application was also designed to be for this specific database, it will not work on other fictional businesses currently.

Conclusion
Our time clock application can help businesses manage their workforce more efficiently by providing accurate attendance and work hour data. The application can also help reduce errors and save time when calculating payroll. We believe that our application can be a valuable tool for the fictional business the code was designed to help.
